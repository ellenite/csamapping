Climate Change Initiatives Mapping in West and Central Africa shiny application

This prototype shiny application (deployed live https://zek-data.shinyapps.io/csamapping/ ) is a prototype app I have developed with data collected to Conduct Mapping of Climate Change Initiatives in West and Central Africa (WCA). This is a work in progress as data collection as well as data cleaning and checking is still ongoing.

The objective of the application is to provide relevant data on the state of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) initiatives in WCA countries through an interactive map and an interactive menu for users to filter projects based on agreed criteria.

The application is made of two main parts:
- An overview tab which shows a map displaying the location of CSA initiatives recorded and allows the user to filter on specific countries. By default, all the countries are selected. 
- An initiative tab which contains an interactive menu for users to filter initiative by location, period of implementation, status and get the lists of initiative(s) matching the selected criteria. In the list, the user can choose a specific initiative and view the initiative detailed information (factsheet).
